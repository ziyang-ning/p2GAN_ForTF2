# UofM EECS 351 p2GAN Implementation
For Neural Style Transfer: https://github.com/ziyang-ning/Neural_Style_Transfer

## Sources & Authors
Based on Paper linked: https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07466 

Original Author: Zhentan Zheng, Jianyi Liu

Original Code: https://github.com/i-evi/p2gan

Editor: Jason Ning

The original code was written in TensorFlow 1.X and was a python script. I have edited the code to work with TensorFlow 2 and made it into a python notebook file for easy use/access. 

I do not own any of the code. Please contact me if this repository needs to be removed. This project was for learning purposes only.

## Purpose
Compare GAN style transfer with Neural Style Transfer

Learn TensorFlow and Singal Processing techniques

## Dependencies
TensorFlow 2, instructions: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip

OpenCV2: `pip install opencv-python`


For Mac instructions: https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/install/tensorflow-install-mac-metal-jan-2023.ipynb

Import NoteBook: `pip install import-ipynb`

TF_Slim: `pip install --upgrade tf_slim`

If you still have dependency problems after these commands, try running the commands inside the Anaconda command prompt.

## How to Use
Modify the `train.ipynb` for training a new model

Run the `render.ipynb` for rendering new images with a specific model

For more on what the parameters do, please check out the original code repo.


# Known Issues
If you interrupted the Kernel of the `Train.ipynb` file while it was training, 
and tries to the train code block again, it will show the error below: `ValueError: Variable generator/enc_0_dw/depthwise_weights already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True or reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE in VarScope?`

To fix this, you just need to restart the Kernel. 

# Training Data
We have tried training on the "impressionism" artworks from the `Artbench-10` 
and all the pictures from the `PASCAL VOC 2007`, links are below. If you want to train your own model, 
you have to have the dataset downloaded yourself too.

`Artbench-10`: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderliao/artbench10

# Results:
The output images can be found in the `rendered_images` directory

The saved models can be found in the `available_models` direcotry
